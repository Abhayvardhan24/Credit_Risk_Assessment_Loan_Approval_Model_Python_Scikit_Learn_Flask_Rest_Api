Loan Eligibility Prediction using Machine Learning
📌 Project Overview
Loan approval is a critical process in financial institutions. Manual evaluation can be slow and biased. This project uses Machine Learning algorithms to predict whether a loan applicant is Eligible or Not Eligible based on financial and personal attributes, helping banks make faster and smarter decisions.

🎯 Objectives
Build a machine learning model to predict loan eligibility
Compare multiple ML algorithms
Achieve high accuracy and reliability
Automate and optimize loan approval decisions
Provide a clean and reproducible ML pipeline
